A software engineer who mainly works with **C# and .NET technologies**.  
This blog is my personal space to **capture experiences, notes, and knowledge** — a kind of journey log to remember what I’ve learned and done before.

You’ll mostly find posts about:
- 💻 Development, coding, and infrastructure
- 📝 Lessons and insights from real-world projects
- 🌏 Bits of life beyond tech — because not everything is code

Outside of work, I’m someone who:
- 🚗 Loves traveling by car, exploring roads and places at my own pace  
- 🐶 Is seriously in love with dogs

At its heart, this blog is a mix of **DevDogs adventures in the development world** and everyday stories.  
Thanks for dropping by — hope you enjoy the ride!
