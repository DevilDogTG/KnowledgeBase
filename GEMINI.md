# Mandate: Centralized Brains (Gemini)
1. Read the global framework rules from `~/.agent-brains/GLOBAL_AGENT.md`.
2. Resolve this workspace's project key from `git remote get-url origin`: drop scheme, credentials
   and host, strip a trailing `.git`. At onboarding this resolved to `DevilDogTG/KnowledgeBase`. If `origin`
   has changed since, `origin` wins — re-run the onboard script.
3. Read the workspace directives from `~/.agent-brains/projects/DevilDogTG/KnowledgeBase/AGENT.md`.
4. Use `~/.agent-brains/projects/DevilDogTG/KnowledgeBase/memory/` for project context.
5. Always write plans to `~/.agent-brains/projects/DevilDogTG/KnowledgeBase/plan/` BEFORE writing code.

No agent state belongs in this repo. Only these entry points and `docs/adr/` live here.


## Automatic Skill Routing

When the user's request clearly matches a session workflow, execute the matching framework skill as if
they had typed the explicit `sk-...` token.

Use this v1 routing table:
- First user message in a new session, "start session", "resume work", "pick up where we left off"
  -> `session-start`
- "summarize this session", "what did we do?", "give me a recap"
  -> `session-summary`
- "end session", "close session", "we're done", "continue later", "handover"
  -> `session-end`

Rules:
- Only auto-route when the intent is unambiguous.
- Prefer the least side-effecting skill that satisfies the request.
- Do not route recap-only requests to `session-end`.
- If the user's wording is ambiguous, ask instead of guessing.
- If the user explicitly writes an `sk-*` token, that explicit invocation wins.
