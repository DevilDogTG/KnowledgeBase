# The system analyzes:
- System Administrator/*.md files
- Developers/*.md files  
- Blogs/DevDogs/*.md files
```

### 2. Suggestion Generation
- Compares potential topics against existing content
- Filters out topics already covered
- Ranks suggestions by relevance and difficulty
- Provides rationale for each suggestion

### 3. Output Generation
- Console output with formatted suggestions
- JSON file with structured data
- Categorized recommendations
- Usage guidelines and tips

## 📊 Understanding the Output

### Suggestion Format
```
1. **Topic Title**
   📁 Category: Infrastructure
   📊 Difficulty: Intermediate
   💻 Technology: .NET/C#
   📈 Trend: AI/ML Integration
   💡 Rationale: Builds on existing expertise
```

### Difficulty Levels
- **Beginner**: Basic concepts, easy to get started
- **Intermediate**: Requires some background knowledge
- **Advanced**: Complex topics for experienced users

### Categories
- **Infrastructure**: System administration, DevOps, cloud
- **Development**: Programming, frameworks, tools

- **Life/Career**: Personal stories, journey, lessons learned
- **Emerging Tech**: New technologies, trends, innovations

## 🛠️ Customization

### Adding New Topic Categories
Edit `tools/topic-suggestions.py` and add your categories in the suggestion methods:

```python
def _generate_custom_suggestions(self):
    custom_topics = [
        "Your Custom Topic Here",
        "Another Custom Topic"
    ]
    # Add your logic here
```

### Modifying Existing Suggestions
Update the topic lists in the respective methods:
- `_generate_sysadmin_suggestions()` - System Administration
- `_generate_dev_suggestions()` - Development
- `_generate_blog_suggestions()` - Blog Topics
- `_generate_trending_suggestions()` - Trending Topics

### Changing Analysis Paths
Modify the `analyze_content()` method to scan different directories:

```python
def analyze_content(self):
    # Add custom paths
    custom_path = os.path.join(self.repo_path, "Your Custom Directory")
    if os.path.exists(custom_path):
        self._analyze_directory(custom_path, "Custom Category")
```
