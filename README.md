# 📖 DevilDogTG's Knowledge Base

![Last 7 days](https://wakapi.dev/api/badge/DevilDogTG/DevilDogTG/interval:7_days?label=Last%207%20Days)

Welcome to my personal knowledge base! This space is powered by Jekyll and serves as a collection of notes, tutorials, and resources for development, system administration, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Run Locally

To run the site locally with live reload:

```sh
./tools/run.sh
```

To build the site for production:

```sh
./tools/test.sh
```

Make sure you have Ruby and Bundler installed. Install dependencies with:

```sh
bundle install
```

### Testing

Run the following to test your Jekyll site locally:

```sh
./tools/test.sh
```

## 🛠️ GitHub Actions

This repository uses GitHub Actions for CI/CD. On every push or pull request, the workflow will:

- Build the Jekyll site
- Run tests to ensure everything works
- Deploy to GitHub Pages (if on the main branch)

See `.github/workflows/` for workflow details.
