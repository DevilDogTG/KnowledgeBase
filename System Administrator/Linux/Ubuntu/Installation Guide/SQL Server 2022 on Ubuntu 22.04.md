curl https://packages.microsoft.com/keys/microsoft.asc | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/microsoft.asc
curl -fsSL https://packages.microsoft.com/config/ubuntu/22.04/mssql-server-2022.list | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mssql-server-2022.list
```

After added repository run to command to install SQL Server

## (Optional) Disable `sa` account

When you connect to your SQL Server instance using the sa account for the first time after installation, it's important for you to follow these steps, and then immediately disable the sa login as a security best practice.

1. Create a new login, and make it a member of the sysadmin server role.
2. Connect to the SQL Server instance using the new login you created.
3. Disable the `sa` account, as recommended for security best practice.
